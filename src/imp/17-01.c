/*
SYNOPSIS

    Solution for exercise 17-01.

REQUIREMENT

    Write a program that displays the permissions from the ACL entry that
    corresponds to  a particular user of group. The program should take two
    command-line arguments. The first argument is either of the letters u or g,
    indicating whether the second argument identifies a user or group
    (The functions defined in listing 8-1, on page 159, can be used to allow
    the second command-line argument to be specified numerically or as a nam).
    If the acl entry that corresponds to the given user or group falls into
    the group class, then the program should additionally display the 
    permissions that would apply after the ACL entry has been modified by the
    ACL mask entry.

SOLUTION

    Unimplemented.
