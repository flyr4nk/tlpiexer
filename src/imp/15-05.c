/*
SYNOPSIS

    Solution for exercise 15-05.

REQUIREMENT

    As noted in section 15.4.6, umask() always sets the process umask and, at
    the same time, returns acopy of the old umask. How can we obtain a copy
    of the current process umask while leaving it unchanged.

SOLUTION

    Unimplemented
