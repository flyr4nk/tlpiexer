CHAPTER 60
SOCKETS: SERVER DESIGN

OVERVIEW

    This chapter discusses the fundamentals of designing interactive and
    concurrent servers and describes inetd, a special daemon designed to
    facilitate the creation of Internet servers.

SUMMARY

    An interactive server handles one client at a time, processing that
    client's request(s) completely, before proceeding to the next client.
    A concurrent server handles multiple clients simultaneously. In high-load
    scenarios, a traditional concurrent server design that creates a new
    child process (or thread) for each client may not perform well enough,
    and we outlined a range of other approaches for concurrently handling
    large numbers of clients.

    The Internet superserver daemon, inetd, monitors multiple sockets and
    starts the appropriate servers in response to incoming UDP datagrams or
    TCP connections. Using inetd allows us to decrease system load by
    minimizing the number of network server processes on the system, and also
    simplifies the programming of server processes, since it performs most of
    the initialization steps required by a server.
