CHAPTER 37
DAEMONS

OVERVIEW

    This chapter examines the characteristics of daemon processes and looks
    at the steps required to turn a process into a daemon. We also look at how
    to log messages from a daemon using the syslog facility.

SUMMARY

    A daemon is a long-lived process that has no controlling terminal (i.e.,
    it runs in the background). Daemons perform specific tasks, such as
    providing a network login facility or serving web pages. To become a
    daemon, a program performs a standard sequence of steps, including call to
    fork() and setsid().

    Where appropriate, daemons should correctly handle the arrival of the
    SIGTERM and SIGHUP signals. Then SIGTERM signal should result in an
    orderly shutdown of the daemon, while he SIGHUP signal provides a way to
    trigger the daemon to reinitialize itself by rereading its configuration
    file and reopening any log files it may be using.

    The syslog facility provides a convenient way for daemons (and other
    applications) to log error and other messages to a central location.
    These messages are processed by the syslogd daemon, which redistributes
    the messages according to the dictates of the syslogd.conf configuration
    file. Messages may be redistributed to a number of targets, including
    terminals, disk files, logged-in users, and via TCP/IP network, to other
    process on remote hosts (typically other syslogd daemons).
