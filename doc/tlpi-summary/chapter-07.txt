CHAPTER 07
MEMORY ALLOCATION

OVERVIEW

    Many system programs need to be able to allocate extra memory for dynamic
    data structures (e.g., linked lists and binary trees), whose size depends
    on information that is available only at run time. This chapter describes
    the functions that are used to allocated memory on the heap or the stack.

SUMMARY

    Using the malloc family of functions, a process can dynamically allocate
    and release memory on the heap. In considering implementation of these
    functions, we saw that various things can go wrong in a program that
    mishandles the blocks of allocated memory, and we noted that a number of
    debugging tools are available to help locate the source of such errors.

    The alloca() function allocates memory on the stack. This memory is
    automatically deallocated when the function that call alloca() returns.
