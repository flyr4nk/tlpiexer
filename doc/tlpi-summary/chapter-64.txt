CHAPTER 64
PSEUDOTERMINALS

OVERVIEW

    A pseudoterminal is a virtual device that provides an IPC channel. On one
    end of the channel is a program that expects to be connected to a terminal
    device. On the other end is a program that drives the terminal-oriented
    program by using the channel to send it input and read its output.

    This chapter describes the use of pseudoterminals, showing how they are
    employed in applications such as terminal emulators, the script(1)
    program, and programs such as ssh, which provide network login services.

SUMMARY

    A pseudoterminal pair consists of a connected master device and slave
    device. Together, these two devices provide a bidirectional IPC channel.
    The benefit of a pseudoterminal is that, on the slave side of the pair, we
    can connect a terminal-oriented program that driven by the program that
    has opened the master device. The pseudoterminal slave behaves just like a
    conventional terminal. All of the operations that can be applied to a
    conventional terminal can be applied to the slave, and input transmitted
    from the master to the salve is interpreted in the same manner as keyboard
    input is interpreted on a conventional terminal.

    One common use of pseudoterminals is in applications that provide network
    login services. However, pseudoterminals are also used in many other
    programs, such as terminal emulators and the script(1) program.

    Different pseudoterminals APIs arose on System V and BSD. Linux supports
    both APIs, but the System V API forms the basis for the pseudoterminal API
    that is standardized in SUSv3.
