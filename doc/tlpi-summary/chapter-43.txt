CHAPTER 43
INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION OVERVIEW

OVERVIEW

    This chapter presents a brief overview of the facilities that processes
    and threads can use to communicate with one another and to synchronize
    their actions. The following chapters provide more details about these
    facilities.

SUMMARY

    In this chapter, we provided an overview of various facilities that
    processes (and threads) can use to communicate with one another and to
    synchronize their actions.

    Among the communication facilities provided on Linux are pipes, FIFOs,
    sockets, message queues, and shared memory. Synchronization facilities
    provided on Linux include semaphores and file locks.

    In many cases, we have a choice of several possible techniques for
    communication and synchronization when performing a given task. In the
    course of this chapter, we compared the different techniques in various
    ways, with the aim of highlighting some differences that may influence the
    choice of one technique over another.

    In the following chapters, we go into each of the communication and
    synchronization facilities in much more detail.
