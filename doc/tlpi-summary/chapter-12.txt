CHAPTER 12
SYSTEM AND PROCESS INFORMATION

OVERVIEW

    In this chapter, we look at ways of accessing a variety of system and
    process information. The primary focus of the chapter is a discussion of
    the /proc file system. We also describe the uname() system call, which is
    used to retrieve various system identifiers.

SUMMARY

    The /proc file system expose a range of kernel information to application
    programs. Each /proc/PID subdirectory contains files and subdirectories
    that provide information about the process whose ID matches PID. Various
    other files and directories under /proc expose system-wide information
    that programs can read and, in some case, modify.

    The uname() system call allows us to discover the UNIX implementation and
    the type of machine on which an application is running.
