CHAPTER 19
MONITORING FILE EVENTS

OVERVIEW

    Some applications needs to be able to monitor files or directories in
    order to determine whether events have occurred for the monitored objects.
    For example, a graphical file manager needs to be able to determine when
    files are added or removed from the directory that is currently being
    displayed, or a daemon may want to monitor its configuration file in order
    to know if the file has been changed.

    Starting with kernel 2.6.13, Linux provides the inotify mechanism, which
    allows an application to monitor file events. This chapter describes the
    use of inotify.

    The inotify mechanism replaces an older mechanism, dnotify, which provided
    a subset of the functionality of inotify. We describe dnotify briefly at
    the end of this chapter, focusing on why inotify is better.

    The inotify and dnotify mechanisms are Linux-specific (A few other systems
    provide similar mechanisms. For example, the BSDs provide the kqueue
    APIs).

SUMMARY

    The Linux-specific inotify mechanism allows an application to obtain
    notifications when events (file are opened, closed, created, deleted,
    modified, renamed, and so on) occur for a set of monitored files and
    directories. The inotify mechanism supersedes the older dnotify mechanism.
