CHAPTER 40
LOGIN ACCOUNTING

OVERVIEW

    Login accounting is concerned with recording which users are currently
    logged in to the system, and recording past logins and logouts. This
    chapter looks at the login accounting files and the library functions used
    to retrieve and update the information they contain. We also describe the
    steps that an application providing a login service should perform in
    order to update these files when user logs in and out.

SUMMARY

    Login accounting records the users currently logged in, as well as all
    past logins. This information is maintained in three files: the utmp file,
    which maintains a record of all currently logged-in users; the wtmp, which
    is an audit trail of all logins and logouts; and the lastlog file, which
    records the time of last login for each user. Various commands, such as
    who and last, use the information in these files.

    The C library provides functions to retrieve and update the information in
    the login accounting files. Applications providing login services should
    use these functions to update the login accounting files, so that
    commands depending on this information operate correctly.
