CHAPTER 39
CAPABILITIES

OVERVIEW

   This chapter describes the Linux capabilities scheme, which divides the
   traditional all-or-nothing UNIX privilege scheme into individual
   capabilities that can be independently or disabled. Using capabilities
   allows a program to perform some privileged operations, while preventing it
   from performing others.

SUMMARY

    The Linux capabilities scheme divides privileged operations into distinct
    categories, and allows a process to be granted some capabilities, while
    beginning denied others. This scheme represents an improvement over the
    traditional all-or-nothing privilege mechanism, whereby a process has
    either privileges to perform all operations (user ID 0) or no privileges
    (nonzero user ID). Since kernel 2.6.24, Linux supports attaching
    capabilities to files, so that a process can gain selected capabilities by
    execing a program.
