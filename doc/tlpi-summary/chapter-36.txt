CHAPTER 36
PROCESS RESOURCES

OVERVIEW

    Each process consumes system resources such as memory and CPU time. This
    chapter looks at resource-related system calls. We begin with the
    getrusage() system call, which allows a process to monitor the resources
    that it has used or that its children have used. We then look at the
    setrlimit() and getrlimit() system calls, which can be used to change and
    retrieve limits on the calling process's consumption of various resources.

SUMMARY

    Process consume various system resources. The getrusage() system call
    allows a process to monitor of the resources consumed by itself and its
    children.

    The setrlimit() and getrlimit() system calls allow a process to set and
    retrieve limits on its consumption of various resources. Each resource
    limit has two components: a soft limit and a hard limit, which acts as a
    ceiling on the value of the soft limit. An unprivileged process can set
    soft limit for a resource to any in the range from 0 up to the hard limit,
    but can only lower the hard limit. A privileged process can make any
    changes to either limit value, as long as the soft limit is less than or
    equal to the hard limit. If a process encounters a soft limit, it is
    typically informed of the fact either by receiving a signal or via failure
    of the system call that attempt to exceed the limit.
