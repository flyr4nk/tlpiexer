/* fifo_seqnum_server.c

   An example of a server using a FIFO to handle client requests.
   The "service" provided is the allocation of unique sequential
   numbers. Each client submits a request consisting of its PID, and
   the length of the sequence it is to be allocated by the server.
   The PID is used by both the server and the client to construct
   the name of the FIFO used by the client for receiving responses.

   The server reads each client request, and uses the client's FIFO
   to send back the starting value of the sequence allocated to that
   client. The server then increments its counter of used numbers
   by the length specified in the client request.

   See fifo_seqnum.h for the format of request and response messages.

   The client is in fifo_seqnum_client.c.
